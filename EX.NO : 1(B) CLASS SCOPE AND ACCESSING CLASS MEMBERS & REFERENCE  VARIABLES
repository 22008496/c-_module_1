# PROGRAM STATEMENT : 

To write a program in C++ to calculate the volume of a cube(declare side as private member ) using 
class methods. 

# ALGORITHM : 
 
1. Start the program. 
2. Define a Cube class with private side variable and public methods to set the side length and 
calculate the volume. 
3. In main, read the side length, create a Cube object, set the side, calculate the volume, and print it. 
4. End the program. 
 
# PROGRAM :
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Cube {
private:
    float side;

public:
    // Constructor to initialize side
    Cube(float s) : side(s) {}

    // Function to calculate the volume
    float calculateVolume() {
        return side * side * side;
    }
};

int main() {
    float side;
    cin >> side;

    // Create an object of Cube with the given side length
    Cube cube(side);

    // Display the volume
    cout << "The Volume of Cube is:" << cube.calculateVolume() << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# RESULT : 
Thus, the C++ Program to calculate the volume of a cube(declare side as private member ) using class methods created successfully.
